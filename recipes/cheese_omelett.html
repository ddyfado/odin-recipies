    <p><h1>Cheese Omelette</h1></p>
    <p><img src="../images/omelette.jpg" alt="a lightly browned cheesy omelette"></p>
    <p><h3>Description</h3></p>
    <p>The cheese omelette is a traditional dish of my kitchen when I don't feel like 
       making anything complicated for breakfast. It usually consists of three eggs with 
       some cheddar, american, and whatever other cheese I can find laying around. Sometimes
       if I'm feeling really fancy I'll season it with a little salt, pepper, and garlic powder.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Cheeses, preferably a few</li>
            <li>Maybe some <i>spices</i> if you want</li>
            <li>Probably butter</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Crack the eggs into a bowl violently. Mix violently.</li>
            <li>Subject the eggs to high heat. Do so without remorse.</li>
            <li>Put the cheeses onto the egg mixture. Watch on until they bubble, boil, and melt.</li>
            <li>Eat your creation, and imagine the lives those eggs could have gone on to produce...</li>
        </ol>
